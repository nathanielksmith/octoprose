currently there is a relatively static Text object that points at
numerous revisions. the Text object keeps title/desc and the revisions
keep the content of the text over time. It's a hasMany relationship.

I am thinkg it might be easier/better to just maintain complete Text
objects over time; ie, a new "revision" is a new Text object with the
same parent. But I also wonder if i should abandon storing texts in
the database and just go full git based. what if; users needed to sign
up via github and i used github as the datastore? it's something to
sleep on.

things on the editor interface are going well. though it is slow i am very happy with how things are shaping up.

i think next i want drafts support; i'm wondering how to do that. perhaps save
new revision "finishes" the "current" revision and then starts a new one; the
current editing text is always saved in the current "WIP" revision. i like
that.

Going to let my computer sleep for a bit and read. I'll let that gestate.
