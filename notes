things on the editor interface are going well. though it is slow i am very happy with how things are shaping up.

i think next i want drafts support; i'm wondering how to do that. perhaps save
new revision "finishes" the "current" revision and then starts a new one; the
current editing text is always saved in the current "WIP" revision. i like
that.

Going to let my computer sleep for a bit and read. I'll let that gestate.
