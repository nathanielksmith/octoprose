# the last library

Eldon sent the message and closed facebook. He sighed and rubbed his temples. No more, he thought; he'd sent enough messages to EMI. They were not going to budge. My Bloody Valentine would never be seen again among the Vintage GaGa and Classic Minaj mp3s in the iTunes storefront. He didn't care that they would have been laden with that DRM that made everyhing decay, die: that supposedly impenetrable and ever-shifting software could be beaten. He knew, he had coworkers who had the software. No big deal. It didn't matter that mp3s--especially the vintage stuff--ran high these days, sometimes $100 an album. Eldon had to have it.

He carefully disconnected his wifi and ran the script Julie had given him. He knew exactly how many tics it took to be done before he could safely start his media player: 57. 57 ways, Eldon thought, that I can be seen; that the hardware in this paper-thin device can tell the world about me. Can tell EMI. Can tell the NSA.

He tapped the media player as soon as the final dot appeared and lost himself in the electric dirge now coming from his headphones. The clock read 23:54.

...

"Eldon." Julie stood behind him. "Eldon." She could hear that drone again creeping out from under his headphones. "Eldon." She cleared her throat and he started, killing his music and ripping his headphones off.

"Julie, I'm sorry, you scared me, jeez. You could've been Dalton."

"Maybe you should turn down your music. Or only listen to the free stuff at work. It's only 10, anyway: do you really need your fix of that valentine stuff?"

"Yeah. I guess. I don't know."

"Look, I just wanted to make sure you knew that if Dalton catches you running my scripts on your tab I'm out. I think he's starting to suspect that someone here is a supplier. Greason got caught two days ago listening to that Spears track that hasn't seen the light of iTunes since 2015. And Hastings, before that. Don't be next."

"Julie, it's not like you're getting us the music. You're just helping us hear it."

"It doesn't matter. The labels doesn't discriminate anymore. I'd be fucked, and you know it." Julie's eyes hardened. Eldon knew she wasn't exaggerating. He also knew she was one of the only hackers left in the office and he needed to stay in her good graces if he was to continue listening to non-market-available music on his tab.

"Sorry, Julie. I'll lay low for a while." Julie nodded and turned to return to her cubicle. Eldon tried to focus on work but the symbols covering his screen were more meaningless than usual. Eldon had no idea what he was looking at: it could be anything from a series of text messages to a cell transcript to some spam email from 2018. He wasn't supposed to know. It baffled him; how could the software he worked alongside of know how to scrub personal information but not the parts that might indicate terroristic intent? Eldon felt he would never understand software. ...

Eldon was depressed. He had taken to staring at the Twitter public feed. He worried sometimes that his professional life was manifesting in unsettling ways in his off-hours but sometimes this was what he needed to distract himself.

The feed seemed a little noisier than usual. Something felt off, but Eldon couldn't make it out. Tweets were coming through especially fragmented and cut-off. A revolution, perhaps, somewhere in Europe. Eldon could remember coming across what he was sure were english translations of Greek chat banter during their second coup de'tat a few years back when he first started his job and wondered if this was more of the same.

This was different though: less desperation. Something like elation. It was exciting: he couldn't remember the last time he heard about something that wasn't completely safe, tame, predictable. Hell, he thought; I'd be happy with terrible news.

<< frieda_mizzi >> Finally! Wait, access

<< jason_beniet >> RT: queue

<< niels_walstrom >> ausgezeichnet,

<< carl_zisson >> was so, stuck in. worth though!

It didn't last long. Eldon wasn't sure how much time had gone by but he could tell when the bots took over. Not only did the tweets become intelligible but they were all bland updates on various CG celebrities and their horrifically predictable vagaries.

He made a note to talk to Julie about it in the morning.

...

"Sure. I noticed it." Julie was doing her best to look serious, even dour. But she was struggilng. "Wonder what it was about."

"It looked like something happened. Something good? Something people had been waiting for."

"Could be." She grinned, but bit her lip as her gaze shot up over Eldon's shoulder. He knew the look; Dalton was near. Their conversation turned to CG celebs and their retainers.

The day passed normally. Eldon didn't bring up the tweets again. Julie clearly knew something about it but he thought it unwise to push the matter given her stern admonishment the day before.

At 16:50 Eldon's machine crashed. This wasn't entirely unexpected. He debated whether he should even bother trying to powercycle and reboot given that it was so close to the end of the day; it didn't matter. In seconds Julie was next to him.

"Looks like it went down again. Let me get that." Julie knelt down and eyed the power cable and socket under Eldon's desk. He could see her profile. She was staring intently at the cable and her skin seemed moist, like she was perspiring.

"1900, 1211 Hussein avenue." Julie whispered, barely moving her lips. Then she was halfway under his desk, jiggling the power cord.

By the time Julie had straightened back up the machine had booted properly. Fresh data was already filling the screen for Eldon to review.

...

Eldon wasn't familiar with the address Julie had whispered to him. He hoped he had heard it right; the neighborhood certainly didn't look like the type a techie like her would spend time in. All around him were pre-storm apartments, evidently spared from complete destruction by the wrath of New York's greatest natural disaster. He wondered how that had been possible; more mysterious was how people managed to still live in these surely-condemned places. For christ's sake, Eldon thought; the doors were hinged and made of wood.

He reached the corner of Presidents St. and Hussein Ave. Julie was there, on the block, standing outside of what must've been 1211.

"You're late." Julie rolled her eyes as eldon pulled out his earbuds. Dreamy vocals and a shrill tone did their best to pierce the air.

"What?" He looked at his tab, pausing the music.

"Let's go." She led Eldon down steps to a basement entrace. It was another old building like those on Presidents St. The door read "DER HERRENHOF."

Inside, Eldon supposed, was something that at least approximated a coffeeshop. The ratty, pre-storm furniture and harsh smell of black coffee made him think it wasn't a chain or even a franchise. As Eldon's eyes focused he saw the tokens of his present: the government required mics positioned evenly over the ceiling, the webcams trailing wires into the floor and walls. The "DO NOT TAMPER UNDER PENALTY OF LAW" signs plastered next to each device. Eldon double checked that his music was off: he didn't want an audio tracer to mistake his loose earbuds as an unlicensed public performance.

"Sit. I'll get drinks." Julie turned and headed towards the counter. Eldon surveyed the available seating and chose a two-top in the corner that represented the intersection between least-dirty and unoccupied.

Eldon wasn't sure why he was here. It certainly wasn't a date: he knew he wasn't Julie's type by a long shot. Something about work, maybe? It can't be anything too dramatic because our conversation will certainly end up in Grason's queue in the morning. He hoped on the way over it was about that curious swelling of censored joy on Twitter but couldn't see how this was any more an appropriate venue to discuss it than work.

"Here you go." Julie returned with two steaming mugs of coffee both as black as her pulled-back hair. Eldon stared at it and thought better of asking if there were any syrups to put in it. By the looks of this place it would be lucky if they even had some soy creamer. "Have you ever been to a place like this before?"

"No, never. I can't remember the last time I went to anything that wasn't a Starbucks."

"Well, get used to it if you want to learn more about the Library. This is a datahaven. It's kind of like..." Julie paused and looked up at the ceiling to one of the overhead mics. "A literal speak-easy. The hackers here run audio scramblers--reconstituted speech pulled from mismashed archival texts and re-normalized--to mask any real conversation. The NSA contractors like our firm just check the mics for tampering and don't tend to notice the little speakers spread throughout the place."

Eldon was terrified. Running DRM-shields was one thing. Audo scramblers? Datahaven? This was hardcore. His hand shook as he sipped his coffee. Julie smiled.

"Don't worry Eldon. It's safe. I've got a whole lot more to lose than you and I'm here, aren't I?" _But what if you're a spook?_ Eldon's animal brain growled inside his head. No, Julie is not a spook. Well, by day she is; she's a spook contractor like him. But she wouldn't be double-crossing him like this. One can only barely hide the rebel streak that comes with being a hacker in 2031.

"I trust you. So what did you want to talk to me about? The Library? Is that the Twitter thing?"

"Yup," she said, that same look of excitement from earlier spreading over her features, "it's an amazing phenomenon. It's an IP address that points to a fileserver. It comes up, the IP spreads, and if you can connect to it the rumour is you can find pretty much anything: music, texts, video, archived websites. Artifacts that have been lost for decades. No DRM, no spook-code, just pure unadulterated data. Like it was when we were kids."

"IP Address? Is that like a website?" Juile's brow furrowed. She wasn't always good at bringing her language down to plain english.

"It's a computer's true identity on a network--or the Internet. When you go to facebook.com or twitter.com or whatever, there's a system out there that looks up a suitable IP address that matches those domain names. Website names. You know what I mean. Anyway, IP addresses are just long strings of letters and numbers." Eldon vaguely remembered learning about this in high school. It was just as fuzzy as Newtonian physics and differential equations.

"Okay. I get that. But who starts the tweets? Surely the NSA has already figured that out, it's not like tweets are anonymous."

"Don't be naive, Eldon. There are ways to circumvent TrueID. Just because a Twitter account exists doesn't mean it represents a real human."

"Fine. How can it spread though? Surely the spooks at Twitter are tweaking the algorithms to look for tweets with IPs."

"Sometimes I forget how the other half lives. Eldon, you need to think like a hacker: the IPs are embedded in the tweets, steganographically. People watch the public feed, analyze what's there, they find messages and codes in the characters and ping their combinations. It's brute force but it works. Inevitably someone solves it and the IP gets linked in clear-text. That's that brief tidal wave of joy you've been noticing." "Huh. What's it like? Have you made it in? Downloaded anything?" Julie's excitement wavered and she sighed.

"No, I haven't made it in yet. I've written some filters to try and find the IPs but they're just not fast enough. I almost made it, once; I could ping the server. It was out there, somewhere, in the dark. The IP was linked to some network in Washington. The connection dropped while I was waiting for an HTTP connection to get through."

Eldon didn't understand several of the words Julie had just said but he got the gist of it. Even for someone not so technically inclined like him he could understand the problem. Websites could only handle so much traffic. Clearly there were only a lucky few who managed to get anything before the Library closed again.

The significance of the Library was obvious to Eldon. He could complete his collection. Finally. Fuck you EMI, he thought: just because you don't think music is worth anything anymore doesn't mean I shouldn't be able to listen to it. His ears salivated; but Julie was too cool for him to act like a fanboy. Plus, he needed her help. _Need to play it cool_, he said to himself.

"So what will you do if you get in? What are you looking for?" Eldon took another sip of coffee.

"Oh, this and that. Music to code to, you know? And books. Old stuff, sci-fi, like 1990s stuff. Stuff like my dad had; stuff that was lost in the Storm. Most of all, I want code. People used to be able to share it; programmers could work together, build whatever they wanted. I want to learn from them. From that era. It's hard to learn from other hackers. We have to hide out in places like this, swap what files we can. We have some code stored here in the datahaven, cut off from the rest of the net. But we're so few. It's not like it used to be when people from all over the world could work together."

"Well. I'm not a hacker, but I can work with you. I would, you know. I'd really, uh, really like to get a few things from the server." Eldon held back a stutter. He couldn't believe that he went from sending his last pathetic, impotent facebook mail to EMI to coming so close to the treasure he craved in less than 24 hours.

"I know you would, Eldon. And that's what I want to talk to you about. I think you've got a gift. I know you think of our contract work as just a dayjob--and it is--but you have a feel for things. A feel for what's going on out there." Julie waved her hands about amidst the hundreds of wireless radio signals that must be surrounding and penetrating them even in this dim basement.

"I certainly didn't notice the ripples the Library's making out there. Once I heard about it, sure, I could pick them out. But it's a subtle problem, and you picked up on it right away. And that's not the first thing: I mean you're one of the best scanners at the office. I've even heard rumours that some people think you're cheating, writing software to help you out."

This was all news to Eldon. He never thought of himself as gifted. Ideas, themes, feelings were just always easy for him to pick out. And him, a hacker? The idea was laughable.

"But that's stupid, Julie. The whole point of my job is to find what even the NSA's algorithms can't. I don't even think you could write software to do that."

"No, I can't. And that's why they're just rumours. Greason doesn't suspect anything like that because he knows better. It's just you. And I think you can help me."

Julie took a gulp of coffee and explained her plan. It made sense to Eldon. He would watch the feeds, looking for trends. If he thought he saw something that could be Library related--either something original or something virally spread--he would flag it and feed it to Julie's filter program. It would use that information to restrict its dataset to similar messages and, hopefully, get at the IP faster. It made sense and Julie would have the program updated to work with him in a matter of days. Eldon and the software would be a team; the software could do the steganographic processing with a richer, human-edited datastream.

"So, what do you think?" Julie drained her coffee and looked eagerly at Eldon.

"I'm in. We'll start in a week."

Julie smiled. The two sat in silence, their brains teeming with possibilties. Julie absently rotated her mug on the table and Eldon slowly sipped the last of his coffee down.

...

Eldon cracked his neck back and forth without taking his eyes off the sceen. He and Julie had been working for hours and he wasn't sure how much longer he could focus on the text flowing by his screen. His fingers were cramping from twitch-hitting the H and L keys which Julie's software used to mark a given bit of text as Interesting or Uninteresting.

As Eldon flagged tweets, facebook statuses, and everything else Julie's crawler could pull in her algorithm ran continuously against the pool of text Eldon sent it. It did the hard work: finding other updates by that author in the same timeframe, looking for related users, and grabbing updates that seemed to semantically match.

The night had started out well. Eldon thought he could feel the swelling of joy that typically preceded a link to the Library. But, he thought, that was four hours ago, and if it's not going to happen by now...

"I'm in." Julie said. Eldon nearly fell out of his chair spinning around to look at Julie's display. Julie was rapidly hitting keys but the screen was still: the site was crude, textual; it reminded Eldon of Julie's software. There was a single text box and, under it, a brick of links like Books, Movies, Music, Pamphlets, Images, and Daguerrotypes. Nothing else cluttered the interface.

"Search, now! Or click on music! Do something!"

"Not yet, I'm still getting data, just a second..."

"It's going to get cut off! Let me, now, please--"

"Not yet!" Julie raised her voice and kept tacking away at the keyboard. Eldon finally noticed a black box horizontally smushed at the bottom of her screen. It was spilling over with green text faster than even Eldon could make sense of. "It's too late to work for us, Eldon. The best we can do is gather information."

Eldon trusted Julie, but he felt a terrific urge to grab the keyboard from her. After what felt like hours, Julie finally touched the "Music" link on the screen.

"Four oh four," said Julie. "But it's okay, really: I think I've gotten what we need."

"How can you say that? We've never got beyond pings before. We've been at this for *weeks*, Julie! We've got nothing to show for it!"

"That's not true." Julie hit a few keys. Usually, it only slightly unnerved Eldon to watch Julie completely control her computer with short, punctuated keypresses; why couldn't she just poke at the screen like everyone else? Or at least use the touchpad? Now, tonight, it enraged him. "We have this."

The 404 page disappared and was replaced with a fracturing of boxes, all but one of them covered in that same green-on-black text he always saw her staring at. One box had an image: a map of the globe. Red points punctured the contitents in a random spray.

"Eldon, we'll never stay connected to the Library long enough to get anything bigger than a jpeg, if even that. It's just too popular. The uplink is saturated within seconds of it going live and, until the IP is blacklisted at the backbone, you have a better chance of winning the MegaTrillion lottery than getting a reasonable connection."

"So? What are you saying? This has all been useless?"

"No. Like I said, I think we have what we need. What we need to *find the Library in the real world*." Eldon stared at Julie. His anger receded; confusion replaced it. The prospect of actually tracking down something like this had never occurred to Eldon. The net was a chaotic, ever-changing bed of lies varying only in their level of institutional approval.

"Look, let me spell it out for you." Julie started motioning at her screen. "I've kept a log of every IP we've seen connected to the Library."

"Wait," Eldon interrupted, "what is an IP again?"

"It's a string of letters and numbers. A computer's address on a network. Or, in this case, the net itself. Normally, for anything subvervise, they're meaningless: no sane person would allow others to connect to their machine directly. That would allow law enforcement to immediately identify them and their location. Instead, people run their connection through any intermediate number of hops."

"Sounds slow."

"It is. I used to wonder how the Library worked like that, but I realized: it doesn't. The only way to get enough bandwidth to do what it does is a direct connection. The flipside, of course, is getting shut down within hours by the law."

"So those dots are IPs?"

"How perceptive. Yes."

"How can the Library move that much? How could anyone keep up that rate of travel?"

"I debug machines, not people," Julie shrugged. "Maybe it's some eccentric billionaire. Or a rogue black-market dealer. Could be anything. But if we ever want access to the Library it'll need to be in meatspace. Either way, by comparing appearances and geographical information I have a pretty good idea about it moves. Or, rather, how they move."

"You think it's more than one person?"

"Don't know. But I think it's more than one Library. I've noticed four distinct movement patterns in three different places: North America, South America, Africa and Asia. It's almost like they take turns, too: I don't think there's a pattern to which continent comes up next but there have definitely never been two consecutive appearances of any given region."

"So... Can you predict the future locations of the North American signal?"

"I'm working on it. On other nights I'm working on another program that does that analysis and prediction. I'd like to keep working with you like we have been to make sure I have a good amount of data." Eldon realized how tired he was.

"Okay. Whatever you say. I trust you. But right now I need to sleep. Can I use your couch?" Julie waved her hand towards the living room.

"Be my guest. It's probably for the best: I think an extra-profressional relationship is probably the best cover we have for all the time we've spent together. Otherwise the scheduling AIs would probably think we were conspirators."

"Which is true."

"Exactly. I was going to suggest you start sleeping on the couch anyway. I'm going to stay up and work."

The faux-leather couch was not the most comfortable thing Eldon had ever slept on. It didn't completely contain him which meant he was curled up all night and bits of chips kept pressing into his arm. On top of the physical discomfort its texture weirded him out. It was hard to believe people used to use skinned and roasted flesh as a covering and, for some reason, even harder to understand why someone would imitate that. Eldon was tired, though, and it was better than the floor.

Eldon woke to the smell of coffee. He sat up and rubbed his eyes. When he opened them again a steaming cup was before him. Behind it was Julie, dressed for work.

"Stay here and drink this. I'm going to get a head start so we don't arrive at the same time."

"Why? I thought we *wanted* the scheduling AI to think we were seeing each other?"

"We do. But typically, coworkers try to hide this sort of thing. I think it will seem more real to the AI if we act..." She trailed off and looked up, thinking. "...Statistically."

"Works for me. I need to wake up anyway. I'll see you there."

...

Eldon was hitting the H key with fury. Everything was uninteresting tonight: just like it had been the last dozen or so nights they'd worked.

"Is it gone? What's going on? I thought we were doing well, considering." Eldon spoke loudly to overcome his loud clacking.

"I think some of the Libraries got taken out. For real. Like, gone from meatspace."

"That sounds very bad. Which ones?"

"Everything but North America's. The others have missed their spot in the rotation; the last two instances we've seen have been North America's. I've never seen consecutive appearances before."

"It doesn't sound like we have much time. Can't we start looking IRL? Do you not have enough data?"

"I think I do. My program is just not all the way there. But I've made good progress tonight."

"I thought you started it...Forever ago, like?"

"These things take time." Julie said after a long pause. "Remember, Eldon. Programming is not exactly easy. It used to be: the net was full of information, guides, references. Now, though? It's like going from Technics to Bloks. I don't even think we stopped at Lego. The only information out there is expensive to get your hands on and very limited. To do any real work I have to use in an older language and getting references for it is harder than finding your precious music."

"That sounds hard."

"It *is* hard, Eldon. Imagine finding yourself in Germany without a tab: no automatic translation of anything to anyone. Instead, you have a pile of paper scraps with a few phrases that you have to dig out of your pocket and re-read every time you need to ask where the bathroom is." Julie's frustration was audible.

"I'm sorry." Eldon focused on his screen again.

They didn't speak for hours.

"Should we call it?" Eldon clenched his hand. It was cramped and felt more like a stiff hook than a hand. Julie didn't answer. Eldon turned and looked at her: she was hunched over her keyboard, typing quickly. Eldon sighed. *This again?* He though. *I hate it when she goes catatonic over code.*

Hours later, Julie broke the silence.

"I've got something."

"What? A location?"

"Yes. Possibly. I finally figured something out about the Library's movements. Cell towers."

"Towers? I thought those were hidden?"

"They are. But things leak. It just takes someone like me learning a bit of welding and getting a contract job out there. The feds don't expect contractors to have any interest in subversion. Especially not in the form of little geo-coord encoders hacked into their tabs."

"Are you telling me you can weld?"

"No, Eldon. Not me. But others. If you know how to ask you can get a pretty good knowledge of cell tower locations. And I think the Library is following them. I also have enough datapoints to have a good idea of the Library's speed."

"This is great, then! Let's get out there and find it!" Eldon couldn't help but smile. Julie turned to face him and gave him a stony look.

"We can certainly try. But if I've managed to figure it out I'm sure the feds have as well. Who knows how long we have?"

"Then let's just go. I've got vacation time. Don't you? I'm sure the scheduling AI assumes we're a pretty solid couple by now, it can't be that suspicious for us to take a trip somewhere."

"I guess you're right. It's going to cost us, though. Our target is Reno."

"I don't care. We've put way too much time into this. Think about it: until now we've dreamt of downloading one or two things: some music, some books. Whatever we could shake off the tree. We're talking about *full access*. Think of all the things we'll discover!"

"That's if we get there first. And if whoever runs this version of the Library even *wants* to talk to us."

"Look, it sounds like this is our only choice. Our last choice. We can't just give up, not where we're this close." Julie finally smiled.

"I guess you're right."

...

"Jefferies, Eldon Franklin? And Muratz, Julie Helm?" Eldon and Julie both nodded at the security guard. They stood before a long counter that stretched about as long as Eldon could see. They were somewhere near its center; on either side of them droves of people were doing or waiting do do exactly what Julie and Eldon were doing: proving their case to customs.

"So. Two lovebirds on a trip to Reno. What's in Reno?"

"We wanted to go to Vegas but this was cheaper." Ahead of time they'd agreed that Eldon would do the talking. He was a little more personable.

"What specific places might you be interested in?"

"Oh, the usual. The Nugget. El Dorado."

"I see. Interesting time to travel: it's the middle of July and you're leaving New York to go to an even hotter place. No major holidays. No family out west to go see."

"It's just the job, sir. We could use a break." The security officer didn't immediately respond. He was clearly scrolling and tapping his way through menu after submenu of details on Eldon and Julie.

"I don't see any Workplace Stress counselling on your record. Why haven't you talked to your superior about it?"

"Oh, it's not that bad, sir. We just wanted a change of scenery. Cubicles are only so exciting day after day." Eldon punctuated this with a wink. Work co-misery was, at least in theory, one of the faster ways to a DHS drone's heart. Luckily for Eldon, it stuck.

"Sure. Well, how long will you be staying?" The security officer knew exactly how long they were staying--at least, as long as their tickets said and whether or not they ever had any history of missing return journies.

"7 days," said Eldon without flinching.

"All right. One last thing. Gambling seems like a new thing for you two. Especially Ms. Muratz. Why the sudden interest?" They'd expected this, of course, and Julie had practiced her response on the flight to Reno.

"Just wanted a little excitement, officer. The life of a software developer isn't exactly exciting. It's just ones and zeroes after all." Julie delivered her lines flawlessly. The officer seemed sated.

"Enjoy your trip." The security officer handed them back their tabs. ...

It was dark when Eldon and Julie got to their hotel room. Its walls were yellow, its framed clip-art wall hangings watermarked, and somehow managed to still smell of cigarettes after ten years of tobacco ban.

"It's a dump," said Eldon. He didn't even want to put his bag down on the rug, which seemed moldy. Julie did not respond; she was glaring at him and holding her tab in front of her. Eldon remembered he was supposed to wait till she started the voice-cover and was embarrassed. He held his hand over his mouth and Julie went back to tapping and swiping on her tab.

Seconds later two voices started a conversation. It was synthetic and derived from overheard snippets surreptiously recorded in NYC. Julie had assembled the conversation-generating software herself, though the snippets had been collected and shared by someone in the datahaven.

"It may be a dump," Julie whispered, "but it's proximate to the cell tower. Just deal with it, okay?" Eldon sighed and started arranging the tattered cot he found in the closet. "Plus, a dump like this is surely not up to code on surveillance. I doubt humans even monitor the room-cam. As long as we don't bring in any hardware or stay up too late or brandish any weapons I doubt we'll look like anything more than a couple who's tiffed at each other."

"Wait, are we tiffed?"

"No, Eldon. But you're sleeping on a cot. Couples usually share a bed."

"Aha. Makes sense. So, any closer on a time?"

"The models are churning, yes. I think it's going to drop tomorrow or the day after; I say we make our way up tomorrow no later than 9pm EST."

"Okay. And your contact? Do you know how to get to the Reno datahaven?"

"Yeah. We'll head over there tomorrow at 7:45pm EST."

"Julie...What do you think we'll find?"

"A person. Someone with a kit. Something portable, retro: 2012-off-the-shelves sort of thing. Lots of radio equipment. But with modern storage."

"Could it be a trap?"

"No, I don't think so." Julie smiled; Eldon thought it was her first one since they got on the plane at La Guardia. "Who would be stupid enough to try and track down a roving pirate website in meatspace?" Eldon laughed. He bet there were people even now, around them in Reno, wondering where the Library was. *How would they feel if they knew it was coming to their neighborhood?*

"Well. I hope she's friendly. Or he. Or whoever it is."

"Me too."

...

Reno was an unpleasant place. Eldon had never been to Las Vegas but he'd certainly seen plenty of footage and pictures of it. Reno was some kind of post-apocalyptic Vegas: dirty, barren, and with 60% of its neon burned out.

"Fuck this place." Eldon looked over at Julie. She was scowling. "Waste of time. Waste of money. Waste of energy. I guess it's not a waste of space, since everything around is desert. Shit."

"Hey," said Eldon, "coming here was your idea."

"I know it was. It's cover. It's not like the scheduling AIs started ignoring us when we left New York. We need to at least make an effort to come off as neophyte gamblers."

"Well, it's about time to go to the dathaven anyway. Shall we?"

"Yes. Please, yes. Let's go. It's not far from here." They walked out into the hot, dry afternoon.

Julie navigated them towards the datahaven with her tab. Within a few blocks she put it away.

"Should be around the next corner. This block." Eldon looked ahead. A man stood on the corner in a blue polo shirt and black slacks. Dark sunglasses covered his eyes.

"He doesn't look friendly." Julie took Eldon's hand in his but did not look at him. Quietly, she whispered direections.

"Turn like we planned. But keep walking. We're a couple and we're looking for a bar called Grayson's. Look straight ahead. And look bored."

They passed the man on the corner and turned right. Eldon could feel the man's gaze as they passed. Three similarly dressed people were standing in front of a squat little building a little way down the sidewalk: two women and a man. They too hid behind sunglasses.

Julie's hand was clammy as they passed the trio. Eldon caught a glimpse of the sign above the old-style wooden door as they passed: Desert Cafe. Once they had made it several blocks and turns from the cafe Julie released Eldon's hand.

"They got there first. Shit. So much for the contact, the tools, possibly everything. I'm sure they're here for the same reason we are."

"You think they're going for the Library too?"

"I'm sure of it. I don't think this is a coincidence. They figured if anyone around here was going to try and interfere with a takedown it'd be at the datahaven."

"So what now?"

"We go, now. We try to warn the operator. I think it's all we can do."

"We could get busted! I don't want to be in the same place as a DMCA takedown! We could even be killed, caught in the crossfire."

"Look, Eldon. Whoever runs these Libraries, whatever group it is: what if they're the last ones? What if this is it? If we just walk away, we could be damning the last good copy of all non-commerically-viable data. The net has been cleansed, Eldon. We lost that battle. Cold storage can only make it so long before someone is caught. I say we go, we do what we can. They won't be expecting us or looking for us--if they were, they'd have recognized and nabbed us back there."

"But we missed your contact. I thought we needed them to get in."

"Not strictly. It would have made it easier, yeah. They had tools we might've needed. Wirecutters and the like. But now we'll just have to see what we can do on our own."

"I've never even taken a walk on anything but floor and pavement."

"Speak for yourself. I was a girl scout." Julie grinned. "I can navigate us through the park. We'll just need to look for a weak spot in the fence. Remember, police states are not evenly distributed: a cell tower near the White House is worth way more to the powers that be than one in bum-fuck Reno. Just trust me. We'll make it, but we have to go right now."

"Okay. Okay, fine. Lead the way, scout."

...

"This feels so exposed. I thought parks were supposed to be, like, green. Covered in trees."

"Yes, Eldon. But we're in a desert. Deserts don't have trees. We're almost there, anyway."

Getting through the park had been easy enough: the cell tower dominated the horizon. They were in sight of the fence that encircled it.

"Do you hear that?" Eldon had asked this question of Julie far too many times since they stepped into the park. This time, however, Julie did hear something.

"Drone. Doesn't sound official though, too whiny." She turned and scanned the sky. It was getting late in the afternoon and the sun was low. "I don't see anything. But I've memorized the sound profiles of the spy drones and, whatever this is, it isn't one."

"So... Should we be worried?" Eldon's eyes searched the skies. Julie had crouched and had her tab on her knees. Julie was tapping rhythmically.

"Eldon, get out your tab. Check the feeds. I think it's on."

"What? There's no one around, it's a desert, we're clearly--"

"Just look. I have a feeling." Eldon obeyed and got out his tab. He pulled up the twitter firehose and started noticing the early-Library joy almost immediately. *How had Julie guessed?* he wondered.

"It's up. Definitely up. Couldn't be clearer."

"Fuck. Fuck, Eldon, Fuck! Look." Julie stood and held up her tab. She activated its front-facing camera and upped the optical zoom. The whiny, small drone was in sight now against the pale blue sky: Eldon could see it with eye unaided. The zoom, however, revealed a small insignia on the drone's underside: a black, scratched, and faded jolly roger.

"I don't believe it. Is that it? Where's its controller?"

"I don't think there is one, Eldon. I know this model; it's designed for autonomic flight." Eldon didn't know what to say. They stood there, staring at the drone's smooth curves and stubby wings. Its whining engine was the only sound in the air. Eldon sat down, no longer caring about getting dirt and sand on his corduroys.

"I guess that's it then. All that information. All that data. Right up there, where we can't touch it. We'd be closer in New York, over a network. I can't believe--"

"Hush. Listen." Julie was still standing, staring up at the sky, her tab now at her side.. Another enginge's sound was in the air. A lower, more menacing sound than the little pirate drone's. "They've found it. This is it."

No sooner had Julie spoken than a tremendous blast filled the sky. She reflexively raised her tab up over her face and staggered backwards; Eldon toppled over from his sitting position. Hot air, even hotter than Reno's ambient dryness, pushed down on them and sizzling bits of plastic and metal pelted their arms and torsos.

Eldon looked up in time to see the unmistakable shape of an official drone soar overhead.
